website I made for my nephews so they can search Pokemon cards by sets, Pokedex mode, or by card name. 

I wrote this website using HTML, CSS, javascript, bootstrap, jQuery, Angular JS, MySQL, and PHP. Let me know if you like the website and if you have any feedback. You can email me at faraj.daoud@gmail.com
